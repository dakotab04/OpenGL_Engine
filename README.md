My motivation behind this project was to build up a solid foundational knowledge of graphics programming in 
C++. I've learned a lot through creating this mini rendering-engine: the rendering pipeline, depth testing, 
frustrum culling, vertex shaders, fragment shaders, vector/matrix math, phong lighting models, scene graphs,
debugging, and the list goes on. I'm definitely still learning, and I plan to implement further functionality 
to this engine in the near future.
